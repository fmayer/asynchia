   contain the root `toctree` directive.

============================================
Welcome to the asynchia 0.1.0a documentation!
============================================
First of all, you are reminded that both asynchia and this documentation are
in an alpha phase. This is the first asynchia release so bugs are to be
expected.

Why would you want to use asynchia then? It is a middle-way between bloat and insufficient possibilities. It is compact enough for everyone to study the code without having to know about the architecture while still enabling you to do about every task.

If this warning did not put you off, the best way to start with asynchia is
reading the two tutorials below and then consulting the examples/ directory.
Good luck, have fun and -- most importantly -- do not forget to report any bugs
and inconveniences at http://github.com/segfaulthunter/asynchia/issues.
You can download the releases at http://github.com/segfaulthunter/asynchia/downloads.
