0.1.1
=====
* Fixed critical bug in DSL.
* Fixed bug in PollSocketMap that caused the timeout to be interpreted as
  milliseconds rather than seconds.
* Improve support for nested expressions in the DSL.
* Add asynchia.ee.DelimitedStringCollector with an efficient implementation
  on Python 2.7.
* Revamp close logic so that handle_close and handle_cleanup are never
  called multiple times and so that the socket map leaves the
  main loop once its close method is called.
* Misc. bugfixes.
* Add SocketMap.is_empty.
* Fix critical bug in PollSocketMap on OSX.

0.1.2

0.1.3
=====
* Introduce SocketMap.call_synchronized.
* Bugfix in forthcoming when data was None.
* Introduce available class-member for socket-maps that shows whether the
  socket-map is available on the system. Referencing a socket-map that may
  not exist and catching name errors NO LONGER WORKS.

* Make asynchia.util.IDPool thread-safe.
* Add benchmark suite.
* Migrate API docs to use sphinx.

0.2.0
=====
* Introduce asynchia.defaults. It can be used to set a global socket-map or to
  set a thread-global socket-map. It can be used with context-managers to auto-
  matically reset the thread-global value to the previous state if the context
  manager block is left. See examples/glob_example.py for an example.
