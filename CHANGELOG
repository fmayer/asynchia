0.1.1
=====
* Fixed critical bug in DSL.
* Fixed bug in PollSocketMap that caused the timeout to be interpreted as
  milliseconds rather than seconds.
* Improve support for nested expressions in the DSL.
* Add asynchia.ee.DelimitedStringCollector with an efficient implementation
  on Python 2.7.
* Revamp close logic so that handle_close and handle_cleanup are never
  called multiple times and so that the socket map leaves the
  main loop once its close method is called.
* Misc. bugfixes.
* Add SocketMap.is_empty.
